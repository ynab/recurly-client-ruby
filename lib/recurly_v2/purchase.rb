module RecurlyV2
  # The Purchase object works in a slightly different way than the rest of the models.
  # You build up the purchase data into an object then pass to either:
  # {Purchase.invoice!} or {Purchase.preview!} and it will
  # return an {InvoiceCollection}.
  #
  # You can build your purchase object with a new account or an existing account.
  # For an existing account, you just need an account_code:
  #   RecurlyV2::Purchase.new({account: {account_code: 'myexistingaccount'}})
  # or
  #   account = RecurlyV2::Account.find('existing_account')
  #   RecurlyV2::Purchase.new({account: account})
  # or
  #   account = RecurlyV2::Account.find('existing_account')
  #   purchase = RecurlyV2::Purchase.new
  #   purchase.account = account
  #
  # For a new account, you can pass in {Account} data, {BillingInfo} data, etc
  # in the same way you would when creating a {Subscription} with a new account.
  #
  # You can also pass in adjustments and invoicing data to be added to the invoice.
  #
  # There are multiple ways to set the shipping addresses:
  # 1. Use {Purchase#shipping_address_id} if you want to apply an existing shipping
  #    address to all subscriptions, adjustments, and shipping fees in this purchase.
  # 2. Use {Purchase#shipping_address} if you want to add and apply a single shipping address.
  # 3. Use {Subscription#shipping_address_id} or {Subscription#shipping_address}
  #    to set a shipping address for only the subscription.
  # 4. Use {Adjustment#shipping_address_id} or {Adjustment#shipping_address}
  #    to set a shipping address for only the adjustment.
  # 5. Use {ShippingFee#shipping_address_id} or {ShippingFee#shipping_address}
  #    to set a shipping address for only the shipping fee. If there are multiple
  #    shipping fees on a single purchase, each can have its own shipping address.
  #    This way, if you ship different adjustments to multiple addresses, the
  #    shipping fees on the purchase can be associated with the same address
  #    as the adjustment.
